For example, the Empire State Building construction was finished in 1931, but it opened in May of that year. So maybe the UN headquarters construction was completed in October 1952, with the official opening on the 24th. Therefore, October 24, 1952 would be the date when the construction was completed.

Alternatively, in 2000. Hmm.\n\nWait, to cross-verify, let's think of major events she participated in. In 2002, she competed at the World Junior Championships in Kingston, Jamaica, in the 3000 meters steeplechase (which was a new event at the time). So if she was competing internationally in 2002, she might have also been active in the 2002 Pan Arab Cross Country Championships. So maybe she won in 2002.\n\nBut I am conflicting between 2001 and 2002. To resolve this, maybe looking for another angle. Suppose the Pan Arab Cross Country Championships is held annually, and she might have won multiple times. However, the question is about the junior race. So probably only once or a couple of times.\n\nGiven that she was born in 1984, her last year as a junior would be 2003 (if the cut-off is under 20). So maybe she could have competed in 2003 as a junior. But some countries or competitions define junior as under 19 or under 18. So maybe 2001 or 2002.\n\nWait, upon reviewing, the IAAF (now World Athletics) defines the junior category as athletes aged 18 or 19 on December 31 of the competition year. So for example, in 2001, a junior would be born in 1982 or 1983. But wait, this might vary by competition.\n\nHowever, the Pan Arab Cross Country Championships might follow their own age categories. Perhaps under 20. So if the competition was in, say, February 2002, then athletes born in 1984 (turning 18 in 2002) would be under 20, right? So maybe she competed as a junior in 2002.\n\nBut I need to clarify. Without exact information, it's challenging, but considering her birth year is 1984, she was eligible for junior competitions until 2003 (if junior is under 20). Let me think: if the cutoff is that athletes must be 18 or 19 in the year of competition, then for 2001, born 1982 or 1983. But Ghribi was born in 1984, so she would be too young in 2001 (17).

If he started working as an apprentice, that might be at a younger age, say 14-16, so perhaps he was already a journeyman by 1815. A journeyman printer would be a trained printer working under the master.

Wait\u2014that's the crux. If currently both Adamantite and Titanium require 4 ores, but earlier one required 5, then the change must have happened. \n\nWait, no. Let's recall: each tier of hardmode ores requires more. Cobalt (3) -> Mythril (4) -> Adamantite (5). The alternative ores: Palladium (3) -> Orichalcum (4) -> Titanium (5). But if that's the case, then the change to Titanium would be a reduction from 5 to 4. Therefore, if in an update, they made all tier 3 ores (Adamantite and Titanium) require 4 instead of 5, then that's the patch. \n\nBut when was that? Let me think. In version 1.2, the Adamantite required 5 ore. Then maybe in 1.3, they changed it to 4? Or in 1.4. \n\nHold on, another way: On the Terraria wiki, it's stated that the recipe for Adamantite Bar is 4 Adamantite Ore, and Titanium Bar is 4 Titanium Ore. If they were both 5 before, the change must have happened. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps they were always 4, and I'm mistaken. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong in my assumption. Maybe the original requirement was 5, but someone told me that even before, it was 4. I need to clear this. \n\nBut given that the user says the required amount was changed from 5 to 4, I just need to find the patch where that happened. \n\nUpon reflection, I believe the change occurred in the 1.4.1 update.

Maybe I can cross-reference with the Terraria Wiki's history section for Titanium Bar. According to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the wiki would mention version history. \n\nFrom what I remember, the Terraria Wiki entry for Titanium Bar would have a history section.

The Journey's End update is version 1.4. The first release of that was 1.4.0.1, perhaps. So the correct answer would be that the change was in version 1.4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even earlier. Wait, if Adamantite required 5, then Titanium also required 5 initially. But to make them more equivalent, maybe they reduced Titanium to 4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps when they introduced the Hardmode ore alternates, they had different requirements, then later standardized them. Wait, for example, Palladium required 3, Cobalt required 3 as of current. Similarly, Orichalcum required 4, Mythril required 4. For the third tier, Adamantite required 5, and Titanium maybe was adjusted to 5 from 4, but that doesn\u2019t fit.

In Hardmode, the first tier is Cobalt/Palladium (3 ore per bar), second tier Mythril/Orichalcum (4 ore per bar), third tier Adamantite/Titanium (5 ore per bar).

Yes, I think that's right. So Seiko's first 300m diver was 1968. But to confirm, when Seiko introduced the 6159-7000, that was their first 300m watch. Then afterward came higher resistance models.

But according to JNU's website, their foundation day is celebrated on April 22, 1969. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think. If the foundation day is April 22, maybe the VC took charge on that day. But foundation day might be the day the university was inaugurated, which could be after the appointment of the VC. \n\nAlternatively, the official charge might have been earlier. The process of appointing a VC would usually happen before the university starts functioning. Therefore, if the university started in April 1969, the VC would have been appointed perhaps a month earlier? But I'm not sure. Given the lack of precise information here, the commonly accepted date is April 1, 1969, for G. Parthasarathy assuming the role. Alternatively, perhaps it's November 1969. But when in November?

Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought. Divaricatum species in other genera tend to have a bushy, spreading form rather than tall. So maybe Pittosporum divaricatum's maximum height is around 3 meters, sometimes up to 4 under optimal conditions. But since the question asks \"up to how many meters,\" it's seeking the maximum. Therefore, based on the information I have, even if typically it's 2-3 meters, if it can reach up to 4, then 4 is the answer. Alternatively, maybe I should check an example.

Alternatively, perhaps even less. Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with another species. For example, Pittosporum eugenioides can grow taller. Let me try to focus. Since I can't look it up, I have to rely on my memory. Let me visualize seeing the plant in a botanical garden. If it's a dense shrub with small leaves, around 2-3 meters tall. So I think that 3 meters is a safe estimate. But I'll have to go with the best answer I can based on my knowledge. So Pittosporum divaricatum typically grows up to 3 meters tall, maybe up to 4 in ideal conditions. However, I might need to be precise here.\n\nWait, let's use logical deduction. The specific epithet \"divaricatum\" suggests a spreading habit. Plants with such a habit often don't grow very tall because their energy goes into spreading outward. Therefore, expecting a maximum height of maybe 3 meters. On the other hand, some shrubs can still reach 4 meters with age. So up to 4 meters is a possibility.

Seaborg's proposal emerged during his work on transuranium elements (e.g., plutonium, americium, and curium) as part of the Manhattan Project.

But as the Clayman Institute specifically, the answer would be after 2004. However, I think Judith Brown's term ended in the '80s, and Deborah Rhode followed in '86. Since the institute was renamed later, perhaps the answer is 1986, acknowledging that it was called CROW at the time. The user may have referred to it by its current name, so the answer would need to mention that the institute was known as CROW when Rhode took over from Brown in 1986, and it was renamed Clayman Institute in 2004.

Let me try searching my memory again. Deborah Rhode was a professor at Stanford Law School. She was active in gender studies. She might have been director of the Clayman Institute in the 2000s.

No, because Gabriel is usually associated with the Annunciation to Mary, not with John the Baptist. \n\nWait, actually, in the Bible, Gabriel does announce the birth of John the Baptist to Zechariah (Luke 1:11-20).

Then other CONMEBOL referees: H\u00e9ctor Baldassi from Argentina, Carlos Simon from Brazil, Pablo Pozo from Chile, and \u00d3scar Ruiz from Colombia. That's five. Additionally, maybe someone else?
