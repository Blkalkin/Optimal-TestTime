I must find the arrest date. From what I recall, she was captured in late June 2022. Let me check that.

Let's start by recalling who Julie Mehretu is. She's an Ethiopian-American artist known for her large-scale, intricate abstract paintings. Her work often combines elements of architecture, geography, and social narratives. Now, the Whitney Museum is a major institution in New York that focuses on American art, and they often have exhibitions featuring contemporary artists.\n\nI remember that she's had significant exhibitions, but I'm not sure about the exact dates. Maybe she had a retrospective or a major solo show at the Whitney? Since the question is about the first time the museum devoted an entire floor to her, that likely refers to a solo exhibition. I think the Whitney Biennial is a regular event, but that's a group show. So a solo exhibition would be a different event.\n\nI tried to think about recent years when her work was prominently featured. I recall that in the past decade, around the late 2010s or early 2020s, there were some major exhibitions. Wait, I think she had a retrospective that was organized by the Whitney and another museum.

Maybe there are others like Mina or Tem. \n\nNow, the question is specifically about languages designated in 1975. I'm not sure what event in 1975 related to languages in Togo. It could be a policy, a census, or some governmental recognition. I recall that some African countries have made certain languages official or national after independence. Togo gained independence from France in 1960, so 1975 is well after that. \n\nWait, maybe in 1975 Togo officially recognized or designated certain Indigenous languages. Let me think.

I need to find out the year that the disco called Infinity in New York City burned down. Hmm, I remember hearing about some famous nightclub fires, like the Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston in the 1940s, but that's not NYC. Then there's the Happy Land fire in 1990 in the Bronx. Wait, was Infinity a disco in NYC that had a fire? \n\nI need to check. Maybe I should start by searching for \"Infinity disco New York City fire.\" Let me think if there were any major disco fires in NYC. The Studio 54 was a famous disco but I don't think it burned down. Maybe the Paradise Garage? No, that closed in the 80s, but not due to a fire.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Infinity was a different club. Maybe I confused the name. Let me think... There's also the Ghost Ship fire in Oakland in 2016, but that's not NYC. Wait, the question is specifically about a disco named Infinity in NYC. \n\nMaybe it's not one of the super famous ones. Let me look up historical incidents. Perhaps checking Wikipedia's list of nightclub fires. Let me see No, but", "timestamp": "2025-03-01T05:22:22.519142"}
