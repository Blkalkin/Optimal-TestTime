Then, in the 2004 miniseries \"Phantom Lady\" #1-4 by DC Comics, Stormy Knight was introduced as the new Phantom Lady, the granddaughter of Sandra Knight. Therefore, Stormy Knight is the third Phantom Lady.\n\nAnother way to confirm: looking at the codenames and the real names. Sandra Knight > Dee Tyler > Stormy Knight.

So, technically, as per the Constitution, it's the President who appoints.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the President of India appointed Kailas Nath Wanchoo as the Chief Justice in 1967. The President at that time was Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan until May 1967, and later Zakir Hussain became President in May 1967. But since Wanchoo was appointed in 1967, depending on the exact month, it would have been either Radhakrishnan or Hussain. Let me check when exactly Wanchoo became CJI.

Let me check another angle. I remember Seaborg's biographical information: he was at the University of California, Berkeley. The announcement of the actinide concept might have been around the time when he started organizing the periodic table in that way.

Burlesque was popular in the late 19th century and often criticized for being too salacious.\n\nAnother thought: In 1880, a play called \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" by Gilbert and Sullivan was quite popular, but that's a comic opera and not particularly spicy. However, there was a parody or unauthorized adaptation that might have been more risqu\u00e9, but that's a stretch.\n\nWait, perhaps \"The", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 526, "total_tokens": 776, "completion_tokens": 250}}, "thinking_continuation": true, "timestamp": "2025-03-01T06:07:36.941969"}

However, national languages are indigenous languages recognized for certain functions. In Togo, \u00c9w\u00e9 and Kabiy\u00e9 are national languages. The promotion of Kabiy\u00e9 was part of northern President Eyad\u00e9ma's policies in the 1970s to balance the dominance of southern Ewe speakers. So in 1975, under Eyad\u00e9ma's regime, perhaps Kabiy\u00e9 alongside Ewe were officially designated. But sources say that Kabiy\u00e9 became a national language in 1975, maybe along with Ewe. However, how many does that account for?\n\nAlternatively, maybe more were recognized. According to Ethnologue, Togo has 39 living languages. But officially designated ones would be fewer. Probably two (Ewe and Kabiy\u00e9) or a small number. But the question is asking about 1975 specifically.\n\nAnother approach: Togo implemented language policies in the 1970s, around the time of President Eyad\u00e9ma's consolidation of power. Eyad\u00e9ma was from the north, and Kabiy\u00e9-speaking, so he promoted Kabiy\u00e9 to national language alongside Ewe.

Without exact data, I have to make an estimate or remember specific numbers. \n\nWait, maybe individual events are structured based on the number of participants. For example, in an individual event, you have preliminary pools, then elimination rounds leading to finals. The numbers might vary depending on entries. But usually, in Olympics, each country can have up to three fencers per individual event. So, if 20 countries sent three fencers each for individual men's foil, that would be 60 fencers. But perhaps not all countries sent three. Alternatively, in 1964, perhaps there were fewer countries participating in fencing. Considering the Cold War era, maybe more European countries and some others. \n\nAlternatively, maybe historical records state participation numbers. Let me try another angle. The official Olympic reports sometimes list the number of competitors per sport. For example, the 1964 Tokyo Olympics had a total of 5,151 athletes (4,473 men and 678 women) from 93 countries. Breaking it down by sport, fencing had a certain number. But how to get that exact number?

Maybe there was a gap year or the count is different. Let me think about a specific year. For example, in 2022, the Streamy Awards were the 12th annual. Then 2022 minus 12 is 2010. Therefore, first in 2010. Wait, but I thought earlier than that.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need another approach. Recall major web series from the late 2000s. The Guild, mentioned earlier, was popular.
