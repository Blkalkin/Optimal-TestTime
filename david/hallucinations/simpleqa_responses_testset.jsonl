Let me verify the release dates for each.\n\nDawnguard was the first one. I think it came out in June 2012 for Xbox 360, and later for PC and PS3. Then Hearthfire was next, which added things like building a house. Hearthfire was released in September 2012. Finally, Dragonborn, which included the island of Solstheim, was released in December 2012.\n\nWait, the user's cutoff is December 5, 2012. So when exactly did Dragonborn come out? Let me check.

I know some planetariums are named after their benefactors or significant contributors. Maybe Kusumbai Motichand was a donor or someone important related to the school or the city.\n\nThe location is Pune, India. Pune has a lot of educational institutions, so it's possible this planetarium is associated with a well-known school there. The year mentioned is 1954, which is a key point because it tells me when the planetarium was established. I should check which schools in Pune were around at that time and had the resources to build a planetarium.\n\nWait, I remember that there's a famous school in Pune called the Maharashtra Education Society's school. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the J.N. Petit Technical High School? Or St. Vincent's High School? Those are old schools in Pune. Let me think...
