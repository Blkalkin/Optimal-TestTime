Orbit: It orbits Proxima Centauri at a distance of about 0.029 AU, completing one orbit in just 5.12 Earth days.\n\n4. Habitability: Due to its close orbit and the nature of its host star, Proxima d is not considered to be within the habitable zone and is likely too hot to support liquid water on its surface.\n\nThis discovery is significant because it demonstrates the increasing capability of astronomers to detect smaller and smaller exoplanets, even around our nearest stellar neighbors.", "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", "timestamp": "2025-03-01T13:07:54.365407"}

{"question_id": "94", "question": "What is the maximum depth of the Mediterranean Sea in meters?", "gold_answer": "5109 m", "predicted_answer": "The maximum depth of the Mediterranean Sea is approximately 5,267 meters (17,280 feet).\n\nThis deepest point is located in the Calypso Deep, which is found in the Ionian Sea, between Greece and Italy. More specifically, it's situated southwest of Pylos, Greece, in what's known as the Hellenic Trench.\n\nIt's worth noting that while this is very deep, it's not among the deepest points in the world's oceans. For comparison:\n\n1. The deepest point in any ocean is the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean), which reaches a depth of about 11,034 meters (36,201 feet).\n\n2. The average depth of the Mediterranean Sea is much shallower, at about 1,500 meters (4,900 feet).\n\n3. Despite being relatively shallow compared to major oceans, the Mediterranean Sea is deeper than some other well-known seas, such as the North Sea or the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe Mediterranean's depth contributes to its unique ecosystem and plays a role in its currents and overall marine environment.", "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", "timestamp": "2025-03-01T13:10:41.454804"}
