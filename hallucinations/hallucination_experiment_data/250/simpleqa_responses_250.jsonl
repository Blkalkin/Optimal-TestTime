In the mid-60s, New York had some prominent senators. For instance, Jacob Javits was a Republican senator from New York who served from 1957 to 1981. Another name that comes to mind is Robert F. Kennedy, who became a senator from New York in 1965, but that's after 1964. So in 1964, the sitting senators would have been Jacob Javits and Kenneth Keating.

I know he served as the Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir around the time of India's independence in 1947. But before that, he had a career in law. The Lahore High Court was a prominent court during British India, so his appointment there would have been before the partition in 1947.\n\nI remember that after his legal career, he went on to become the Prime Minister of J&K in 1947. So his judgeship should predate that. Let me check the timeline. He was part of the Radcliffe Commission, which was set up in 1947 to demarcate the boundaries between India and Pakistan. So if he was involved in that, he must have already had a significant legal standing.\n\nLooking up some sources, I found that he was a judge at the Lahore High Court in the early 1940s.
